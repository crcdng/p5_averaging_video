# p5: Averaging Video 
## Inspired by Photographs of Films

Processing sketch that averages input from the webcam, inspired by Jason Shulman's [Photographs of Films](http://www.jasonshulmanstudio.com/photographs-of-films/).

Leave it running for a while. Click to save a screenshot into the sketch folder.

Written in [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) in 2017 using the P5 Video library. Updated to run on Mac OSX 10.5 Catalina (see below).

To run, download the ZIP file, unpack and rename the folder to `p5_sensory_con_fusion`. Copy this folder into your Processing sketch folder. You might have to install the P5 Video library from the Processing GUI (`Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library`).

Read the comments in the sketch file for details and current issues.
 
#### Update (2020) 
Processing is broken on Mac computers with Mac OSX 10.5 Catalina. For a workaround and to run this sketch with Processing 3.5.4 see:
